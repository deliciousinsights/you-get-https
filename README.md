# You Get HTTPS!

You-Get-HTTPS is a trusted-cert HTTPS frontliner for your local development servers.

![You get HTTPS! And you get HTTPS! Everyone gets HTTPS!](./assets/you-get-https.gif)

You can use it to obtain a no-warnings, trusted local HTTPS frontliner for any local dev server you may have, mapping domains over the local ports of these servers.  The URL's FQDN is passed along, with HTTPS protocol info, to the proxied service.

As this is a thin wrapper over the amazing [devcert](https://github.com/davewasmer/devcert#readme) tool, you automagically get all the goodness from devcert, including:

- Automatic creation and systemwide installation of a local trusted CA.
- Automatic certificate creation for any domain you configure, and all their subdomains, using that trusted CA.
- Automatic configuration of extra trust requirements for Chrome Linux and Firefox, when applicable.

## Why not just use devcert / mkcert directly?

FIXME:REASONS

## Installation

```bash
npm install --global you-get-https
```

## Configuration

The configuration lives in a `you-get-https.toml` file in your `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` (or by default, `.config` directory in your user profile's home directory).

If you don't know about [TOML](https://github.com/toml-lang/toml/tree/v0.5.0#readme), check this link now. It's amazing for friendly, human-readable yet highly-expressive configuration files.  You can get a [VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tamasfe.even-better-toml) for even easier editing.

You specify your domain mappings through the `mappings` table.  Keys are domain names and values are port numbers.  Here's an example:

```toml
[mappings]
# Masterclass project
assets.masterclass.test = 3001
masterclass.test = 3000

# PremierCadeau project
assets.premiercadeau.test = 5001
premiercadeau.test = 5000
```

### Domain precedence

You should list more specific domains first for now, so they don't get swallowed up by a more-generic domain mapping.  I'll eventually guarantee this regardless of config ordering, but for now, please ensure this yourself.

## Running You-Get-HTTPS

Unless you're going for a custom port above 1024, the default HTTPS port (443) requires administrator privileges for binding.

On Linux (including WSL) or OSX, this means you need to `sudo` it.

On Windows, if you're running it from a command line (Command Prompt, Powershell, etc.), you need to start that command line as Administrator.  If you're running it through a shortcut file or direct call, this needs to be configured as Administrator or invoked with that specific mode.

Should that be an issue, you can configure a different front listening port, but you'll need to specify that in your URLs then:

```toml
[frontline]
# Results in e.g. https://premiercadeau.test:1337/
# Does not require admin privileges to bind.
listen = 1337
```
